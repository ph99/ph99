- 👋 Hi, I’m @ph99
- 👀 I’m interested in statistical signal processing, compressed sensing, acoustic wave propagation modeling, communications signal processing, GPGPU programming, and machine learning
- 🌱 I’m currently exploring use of K-SVD in various applications in underwater acoustic signal processing
- 💞️ I’m probably too busy to collaborate on new projects in the next few months.
- 📫 How to reach me: email
